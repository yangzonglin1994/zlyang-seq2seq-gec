## Sequence to sequence learning with Keras
Sequence to sequence learning using several deep models.

## Implemented models
- Baseline model: Attention Seq2Seq model.

## Get started
- The main entry point is at `train.py`.
- Test with very small data set using `test.py` before training.
- Grid search hyper params with `grid_search.py`.
- Use `apply.py` to load model trained.
